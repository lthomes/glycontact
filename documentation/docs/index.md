# GlyContact: 3D Analysis of Glycan Structures 🧬

**GlyContact** is a Python package for retrieving, processing, and analyzing 3D glycan structures from GlycoShape, molecular dynamics, NMR, or X-ray crystallography.

While glycans are traditionally represented as linear text sequences, their **branched structures and high flexibility** create a complex 3D landscape that affects their biological function.

## 🎯 Key Features

GlyContact provides a comprehensive toolkit that enables researchers to:

- 🧠 Visualize complex glycan structures with **3D-SNFG symbols**
- 📊 Quantify structural properties such as **SASA** and **flexibility**
- 🔍 Analyze **conformational preferences** and structure variability
- 🔗 Compare different glycan structures
- 🤖 Generate structural features for **machine learning applications**

> These capabilities help bridge the gap between **glycan sequence** and **function** by revealing the critical spatial arrangements that determine molecular recognition.
