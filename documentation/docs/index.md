# GlyContact: 3D Analysis of Glycan Structures
---
**GlyContact** is a Python package for retrieving, processing, and analyzing 3D glycan structures from GlycoShape, molecular dynamics, NMR, or X-ray crystallography.

While glycans are traditionally represented as linear text sequences, their **branched structures and high flexibility** create a complex 3D landscape that affects their biological function.


## **Key Features**
---
GlyContact provides a comprehensive toolkit that enables researchers to:

- Visualize complex glycan structures with **3D-SNFG symbols**
- Quantify structural properties such as **SASA** and **flexibility**
- Analyze **conformational preferences** and structure variability
- Compare different glycan structures
- Generate structural features for **machine learning applications**

These capabilities help bridge the gap between **glycan sequence** and **function** by revealing the critical spatial arrangements that determine molecular recognition.
