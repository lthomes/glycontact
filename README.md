# glycontact
Adaptation of Implose Protein Contact Maps to Glycans using GlycoShape 3D data

**Content of this repository:**
- *process.py*: Python module containing all processing functions, from downloading Glycoshape data to creating distance matrices
- *visualize.py*: Python module containing all the functions required to generate plots
- *glycontactNotebook.ipynb*: Notebook demonstrating how to use all the functions to process glycan data
- *process_data.ipynb*: Notebook used to develop the package: testing PDB to IUPAC conversions, creating ways to analyze glycans...

PDB files are in the glycans_pdb folder. Folders are named using to the IUPAC glycan nomenclature and contain PDB files extracted from https://glycoshape.org/
